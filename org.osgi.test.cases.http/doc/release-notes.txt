HTTP TEST SUITE RELEASE NOTES R2

Changes

In the second release of the http test suite the following testcases have been changed:

  Odd registration name (R1 TC7) removed
  Security (TC51)	         updated
  Exceptions (TC52)              updated
  Large URL (TC56)               updated
  Odd URL (TC57)                 updated
  Multiple names in URL (TC58)   updated
 
Structure of thes suite has also been reworked to contain fewer files.


Running the testsuite

To run the testsuite use the IBM log service and the beta-2 versions of Gatespace framework and http. On NT4 this would look someting like:

java -Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=8080 -jar %PUBLIC%\framework.jar  -init -install file:%PUBLIC%\org.osgi.test.director.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\log.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\servlet_.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\http.jar -launch -start 1 -start 2 -start 3 -start 4

to start the test harness and

java -Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=80  -jar %PUBLIC%\framework.jar -init -install http://localhost:8080/osgi/test/org.osgi.test.target.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\log.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\servlet_.jar -install file:%PUBLIC%\http.jar -launch -start 1 -start 2 -start 3 -start 4

to start the framework under test. Then start the applet that comes together with the Ericsson test tools (org.osgi.test.director.jar, org.osgi.test.target.jar and the NetscapeApplet) and install org.osgi.test.cases.http.jar.


Remarks

To work around problems with POST to HTTP service reference implementation the POST request is setup in the following manner:

	URL u = new URL("http://thehost:80/httptest/servlet3?p1=0&p2=1");	HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection u.openConnection();
	conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
 	conn.setDoOutput(true);
 	conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "text/plain");
	PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
 	pw.flush();
	conn.connect();
 	InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
	...
	
in stead of

	URL u = new URL("http://thehost:80/httptest/servlet3?p1=0&p2=1");	HttpURLConnection c = (HttpURLConnection)u.openConnection();
	c.setRequestMethod("POST");
	InputStream in = c.getInputStream();
	...

Both ways work with the sun jswdk webserver, only the first with Gatespaces.
