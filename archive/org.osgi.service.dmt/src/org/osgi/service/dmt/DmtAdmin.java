/**
 * An interface providing methods to open sessions and send alerts. The 
 * implementation of <code>DmtAdmin</code> should register itself in the OSGi 
 * service registry as a service. <code>DmtAdmin</code> is the entry point for 
 * applications to use the DMT API. The <code>getSession</code> methods are used
 * to open a session on a specified subtree of the DMT. A typical way of usage:
 * <pre>
 *  serviceRef = context.getServiceReference(DmtAdmin.class.getName());
 *  DmtAdmin factory = (DmtAdmin) context.getService(serviceRef);
 *  DmtSession session = factory.getSession(&quot;./OSGi/Configuration&quot;);
 *  session.createInteriorNode(&quot;./OSGi/Configuration/my.table&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The methods for opening a session take a node URI (the session root) as 
 * parameter. All segments of the given URI must be within the segment length
 * limit of the implementation, and the special characters '/' and '\' must be
 * escaped (preceded by a '\').  Any string can be converted to a valid URI
 * segment using the {@link #mangle(String)} method.
