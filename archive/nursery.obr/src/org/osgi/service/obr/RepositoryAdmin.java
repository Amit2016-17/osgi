 * memory, etc.</li>
 *  <li>Requirements - A named filter expression. The filter must be satisfied

 *  from other resources or from the platform. If multiple resources provide the
 *  requested capability, one is selected. (### what algorithm? ###)</li>
 *  <li>Requests - Requests are like requirements, except that a request can be
 *  fullfilled by 0..n resources. This feature can be used to link to resources
 *  that are compatible with the given resource and provide extra functionality. 
 *  For example, a bundle could request all its known fragments. The UI associated
 *  with the repository could list these as optional downloads.</li>
