  <title>Distribution and Feedback License, Version 2.0</title>

  <section>
    <title>License Grant</title>

    <para>The OSGi Alliance hereby grants you a limited copyright license to
    copy and display this document (the “Distribution”) in any medium without
    fee or royalty. This Distribution license is exclusively for the purpose
    of reviewing and providing feedback to the OSGi Alliance. You agree not to
    modify the Distribution in any way and further agree to not participate in
    any way in the making of derivative works thereof, other than as a
    necessary result of reviewing and providing feedback to the Distribution.
    You also agree to cause this notice, along with the accompanying consent,
    to be included on all copies (or portions thereof) of the Distribution.
    The OSGi Alliance also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide,
    fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to
    sublicense) under any applicable copyrights, to create and/or distribute
    an implementation of the Distribution that: (i) fully implements the
    Distribution including all its required interfaces and functionality; (ii)
    does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the OSGi Name Space,
    or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
    fields or methods within the OSGi Name Space other than those required and
    authorized by the Distribution. An implementation that does not satisfy
    limitations (i)-(ii) is not considered an implementation of the
    Distribution, does not receive the benefits of this license, and must not
    be described as an implementation of the Distribution. "OSGi Name Space"
    shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin
    with "org.osgi" or any recognized successors or replacements thereof. The
    OSGi Alliance expressly reserves all rights not granted pursuant to these
    limited copyright licenses including termination of the license at will at
    any time.</para>

    <para>EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED COPYRIGHT LICENSES GRANTED ABOVE, THE OSGi
    ALLIANCE DOES NOT GRANT, EITHER EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY, A LICENSE TO ANY
    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IT, OR ANY THIRD PARTIES, OWN OR CONTROL. Title to
    the copyright in the Distribution will at all times remain with the OSGi
    Alliance. The example companies, organizations, products, domain names,
    e-mail addresses, logos, people, places, and events depicted therein are
    fictitious. No association with any real company, organization, product,
    domain name, email address, logo, person, place, or event is intended or
    should be inferred.</para>

    <para>THE DISTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND THE OSGi ALLIANCE
    (INCLUDING ANY THIRD PARTIES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISTRIBUTION)
    MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE DISTRIBUTION
    ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH CONTENTS
    WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER
    RIGHTS.</para>

    <para>NEITHER THE OSGi ALLIANCE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY
    DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
    OF OR RELATING TO ANY USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION.</para>

    <para>Implementation of certain elements of this Distribution may be
    subject to third party intellectual property rights, including without
    limitation, patent rights (such a third party may or may not be a member
    of the OSGi Alliance). The OSGi Alliance is not responsible and shall not
    be held responsible in any manner for identifying or failing to identify
    any or all such third party intellectual property rights.</para>

    <para>The Distribution is a draft. As a result, the final product may
    change substantially by the time of final publication, and you are
    cautioned against relying on the content of this Distribution. You are
    encouraged to update any implementation of the Distribution if and when
    such Distribution becomes a final specification.</para>

    <para>The OSGi Alliance is willing to receive input, suggestions and other
    feedback (“Feedback”) on the Distribution.  By providing such Feedback to
    the OSGi Alliance, you grant to the OSGi Alliance and all its Members a
    non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
    royalty-free copyright license to copy, publish, license, modify,
    sublicense or otherwise distribute and exploit your Feedback for any
    purpose.  Likewise, if incorporation of your Feedback would cause an
    implementation of the Distribution, including as it may be modified,
    amended, or published at any point in the future (“Future Specification”),
    to necessarily infringe a patent or patent application that you own or
    control, you hereby commit to grant to all implementers of such
    Distribution or Future Specification an irrevocable, worldwide,
    sublicenseable, royalty free license under such patent or patent
    application to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
    export products or services that implement such Distribution or Future
    Specification.  You warrant that (a) to the best of your knowledge you
    have the right to provide this Feedback, and if you are providing Feedback
    on behalf of a company, you have the rights to provide Feedback on behalf
    of your company; (b) the Feedback is not confidential to you and does not
    violate the copyright or trade secret interests of another; and (c) to the
    best of your knowledge, use of the Feedback would not cause an
    implementation of the Distribution or a Future Specification
    to necessarily infringe any third-party patent or patent application known
    to you.  You also acknowledge that the OSGi Alliance is not required to
    incorporate your Feedback into any version of the Distribution or a Future
    Specification.</para>

    <para>I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
