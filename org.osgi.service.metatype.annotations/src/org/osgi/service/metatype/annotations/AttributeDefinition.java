/**
 * {@code AttributeDefinition} information for the annotated method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each method of a type annotated by {@link ObjectClassDefinition} has an
 * implied AttributeDefinition annotation. This annotation is only used to
 * specify non-default AttributeDefinition information.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@code id} of this AttributeDefinition is generated from the name of the
 * annotated method. The annotated method name is processed from left to right
 * changing each character as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A dollar sign ({@code '$'} &#92;u0024) is removed unless it is followed
 * by another dollar sign in which case the two consecutive dollar signs (
 * {@code '$$'}) are changed to a single dollar sign.</li>
 * <li>A low line ({@code '_'} &#92;u005F) is changed to a full stop (
 * {@code '.'} &#92;u002E) unless is it followed by another low line in which
 * case the two consecutive low lines ({@code '__'}) are changed to a single low
 * line.</li>
 * <li>All other characters are unchanged.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This id is the value of the id attribute of the generate AD element and is
 * used as the name of the corresponding configuration property.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation is not processed at runtime. It must be processed by tools
 * and used to generate a Meta Type Resource document for the bundle.
 * 
 * @see "The AD element of a Meta Type Resource."
