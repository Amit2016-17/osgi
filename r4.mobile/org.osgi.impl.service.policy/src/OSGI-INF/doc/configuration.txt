You can have the following data configured in the policy RI:

- system IMEI number, by setting the org.osgi.util.gsm.imei system property
- system IMSI number, by setting the org.osgi.util.gsm.imsi system property

Both numbers must be a string of 15 digits.

Example, add the following parameters to the java vm command line at startup:
-Dorg.osgi.util.gsm.imei=012345678901234 -Dorg.osgi.util.gsm.imsi=012345678901234

It is recommended that the policy bundle is started before bundles that have ConditionalPermissions
assigned to them.
