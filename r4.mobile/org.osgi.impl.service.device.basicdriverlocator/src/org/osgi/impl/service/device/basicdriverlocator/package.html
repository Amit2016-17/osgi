      This implementation of a DriverLocator Service is intended to serve as a example
      and starting-point to develop "real world" DriverLocator code.
    </p>
    <p>
      For simplicity reasons, this implementation does not rely on any backend, but
      is intended as a local stand-alone solution. The device driver bundles are
      expected to be accessible via an URL (typically a file URL).</br>
      The "database" is represented by a java property file located in the
      gateways filesystem.</br>
      An example database file can be found in the directory <code>./data</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, an URL to another driver DB property file can
      be specified when starting the platform by specifying a system 
      property <code>org.osgi.service.basicdriverlocator.dburl</code>
    </p>
