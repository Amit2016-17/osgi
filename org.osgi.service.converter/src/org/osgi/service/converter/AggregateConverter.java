/**
 * The Aggregate Converter service aggregates the Converter services present in
 * the service registry. That is, a Converter service provides the converting
 * facility for one or more types, an Aggregate Converter service provides
 * converting for any object by using the Converter services present in the
 * service registry, as well as providing a number of basic type conversions.
 * When called, an Aggregate Converter must use the
 * {@link Converter#OSGI_CONVERTER_TYPE} property of the Converter services to
 * determine which service to use. 
 * 
 * Finding the right converter must follow the
 * following rules:
 * 
 * The goal of the type conversion is to convert a source object {@code s} with
 * type {@code S} to a target type {@code T<P1..Pn>}. The Aggregator Converter
 * must attempt to find the first Converter service (in service.ranking order)
 * that successfully performs this conversion.
 * 
 * If no capable Converter service can be found, the Aggregator Converter
 * service must provide a number of basic conversions as described in the
 * specification. These conversions handle arrays, collections, and many
 * built-in types, see the specification.
 * 
 * An Aggregate Formatter must not register with a
 * {@link Converter#OSGI_CONVERTER_TYPE} service property.
 * 
 * The Aggregate Converter service uses the same signature as the Converter
 * Service, this interface is therefore a marker interface to simplify getting
 * access to the Aggregator service.
