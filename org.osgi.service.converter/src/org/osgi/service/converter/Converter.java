/**
 * A Converter service can convert an object to another <em>type</em>. For
 * example the command shell can use this service to coerce the source type (in
 * this case often a string) to a destination type, for example a parameter in a
 * method. However, converters are general converters, they must be able to
 * handle any source type though it is not required that they can actually
 * perform the conversion.
 * 
 * A Converter service must register with the {@link #OSGI_CONVERTER_TYPE}
 * service property. This property specifies the names of the class and
 * interfaces this Converter service can convert to one or more target types.
 * Multiple Converter services can provide conversion of the same
 * class/interface. An {@link AggregateConverter} must use these services in
 * service ranking order, the first Converter service that can convert the
 * source object to the target type will be chosen.
 * 
 * Due to different class space the target type can be a recognized class name
 * but still fail because the converter belongs to another class space.
 * Converter services must therefore be careful to check if they are in the same
 * class space as the target type.
