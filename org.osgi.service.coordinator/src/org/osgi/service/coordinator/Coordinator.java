/**
 * A Coordinator service coordinates activities between different parties.
 * 
 * The Coordinator can create Coordination objects. Once a Coordination object
 * is created, it can be pushed on a thread local stack
 * {@link Coordination#push()} as an implicit parameter for calls to other
 * parties, or it can be passed as an argument. The current top of the thread
 * local stack can be obtained with {@link #peek()}.
 * 
 * The {@link #addParticipant(Participant)} method on this service or the
 * {@link Coordination#addParticipant(Participant)} method can be used to
 * participate in a Coordination. Participants participate only in a single
 * Coordination, if a Participant object is added to a second Coordination the
 * {@link Coordination#addParticipant(Participant)} method is blocked until the
 * first Coordination is terminated.
 * 
 * A Coordination ends correctly when the {@link Coordination#end} method is
 * called before termination or when the Coordination fails due to a timeout or
 * a failure. If the Coordination ends correctly, all its participants are
 * called on the {@link Participant#ended(Coordination)} method, in all other
 * cases the {@link Participant#failed(Coordination)} is called.
 * 
 * The typical usage of the Coordinator service is as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Coordination coordination = coordinator.begin(&quot;mycoordination&quot;,0);
 * try {
 * 	doWork();
 * }
 * finally {
 * 	coordination.end();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In the doWork() method, code can be called that requires a callback at the
 * end of the Coordination. The doWork method can then add a Participant to the
 * coordination. This code is for a Participant.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * void doWork() {
 * 	if (coordinator.addParticipant(this)) {
 * 		beginWork();
 * 	}
 * 	else {
 * 		beginWork();
 * 		finishWork();
 * 	}
 * }
 * 
 * void ended() {
 * 	finishWork();
 * }
 * 
 * void failed() {
 * 	undoWork();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Life cycle. All Coordinations that are begun through this service must
 * automatically fail before this service is ungotten.
