 * Enable multiplexing of the standard IO streams for input, output, and error.

 * The standard streams are singletons, this service replaces the singletons
 * with a service that has a per-thread stack of streams. If no streams are
 * pushed output is directed to the original streams that were set before this
 * service was started.
 * 
 * Users can push a triplet of streams. After this push, all standard IO is
 * redirected through the given streams for that thread only. When the user is
 * ready, he can pop the streams and the previous situation is restored.

	 * This method can be called multiple times on the same thread. A Thread IO
	 * implementation must stack these calls. It is paramount that users of this
	 * service ensure they follow the bracketing. The following code snippet

	 *   try {

	 *   }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * The streams will automatically be canceled when the bundle that has
	 * gotten this service is stopped or returns this service. If the ThreadIO
	 * service holds the only reference to a stream, it must remove this stream
	 * from the stack of streams.
	 *

	 *        used. If {@code null} then ignore.
	 * @param out PrintStream to use for the current thread when System.out is
	 *        used. If {@code null} then ignore.
	 * @param err PrintStream to use for the current thread when System.err is
	 *        used. If {@code null} then ignore.
	 * @return and entry that can be used to close/pop the push for life cycle control.
