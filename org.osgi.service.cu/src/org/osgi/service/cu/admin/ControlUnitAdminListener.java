/**
 * Applications interested in receiving events for creation and/or deletion of a
 * specified set of control unit instances may implement this interface and
 * register it as a service in the OSGi registry. {@link ControlUnitAdmin}
 * service is responsible for tracking these services and to deliver the
 * appropriate events to them.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A service registration property may be used as a filter to limit the number
 * of received events and to specify certain control unit to listen for. The key
 * of the property is
 * {@link org.osgi.service.cu.ControlUnitConstants#EVENT_FILTER} whos value is a
 * <code>String</code> representing an LDAP filtering expression. The
 * properties that may be used in the LDAP filer are
 * {@link ControlUnitAdmin#EVENT_TYPE},
 * {@link org.osgi.service.cu.ControlUnitConstants#TYPE} and
 * {@link org.osgi.service.cu.ControlUnitConstants#ID}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The filter states what types of events, and events for which control units to
 * be received. The listener will only be notified for events regarding control
 * units whose ID and type satisfy this filter, if the events match the event-
 * filtering criterion. If property
 * {@link org.osgi.service.cu.ControlUnitConstants#EVENT_FILTER} is not present,
 * the listener will receive events for all control units.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Listeners may use the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.cu.ControlUnitConstants#EVENT_SYNC} property to
 * specify that events must be delivered to them synchronously.
