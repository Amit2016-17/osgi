Distributed OSGi TCK

Instructions:

The TCK registers a service with the interfaces 
 org.osgi.test.cases.distribution.common.A and
 org.osgi.test.cases.distribution.common.B
The remote interfaces property is set to export both interfaces.

The TCK then creates a ServiceTracker to find a proxy implementation of Service A and B.
It identifies the proxy by looking for the mandatory osgi.remote property set on the service.

A RI tested against this TCK needs to make the service A and B available locally via proxy(ies).
