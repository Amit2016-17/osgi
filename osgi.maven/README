This directory is made to hold the maven upload scripts. The current makefile is not working but a 
similar file is currently used by Peter Kriens to upload.

Some notes from David Bosschaert:
I had success with the following command for compendium 4.3 (note that in Maven the compendium bundle has the artifact ID org.osgi.compendium, not org.osgi.cmpn).
$ java -jar ./licensed/repo/biz.aQute.bnd/biz.aQute.bnd-latest.jar -exceptions -trace maven bundle -passphrase xxx -output maven.osgi.cmpn.jar -javadoc file:///users/david/tmp/osgi.cmpn.javadoc-4.3.0.zip -url http://www.osgi.org -nodelete -group org.osgi -artifact org.osgi.compendium file:///users/david/tmp/osgi.cmpn-4.3.0.jar

Obtained javadoc from here: http://www.osgi.org/download/r4v43/osgi.cmpn.javadoc-4.3.0.zip

Sonatype instructions are here: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Uploading+3rd-party+Artifacts+to+The+Central+Repository
Note, if you get the following error when uploading to Nexus:
  Artifact upload failed. Illegal access of staging profile 'xxx'
you need to access the folks at Sonatype to change the permissions and give you access. In my case Brian Fox did this for me.
